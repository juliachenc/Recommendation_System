# Recommendation_System

Task 1: Jaccard based LSH
Focus on the “0 or 1” ratings rather than the actual ratings/stars from the users.
Specifically, if a user has rated a business, the user’s contribution in the characteristic matrix is 1. 
If the user hasn’t rated the business, the contribution is 0. 
Final acc:  precision = 0.99, recall = 0.99

Task 2:  Recommendation System 
Case 1: Item-based CF recommendation system with Pearson similarity
Case 2: Model-based recommendation system
Case 3: Hybrid recommendation system
